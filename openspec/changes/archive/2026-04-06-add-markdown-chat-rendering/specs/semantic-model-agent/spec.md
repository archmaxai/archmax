## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Chat Interface

The Semantic Models page SHALL render a chat interface where the user can converse with an AI agent to create, edit, and explore semantic models for the selected project. Assistant messages SHALL be rendered as markdown with support for headings, lists, code blocks (with language label and copy button), bold, italic, tables, blockquotes, links, and horizontal rules. User messages SHALL remain plain text.

#### Scenario: User sends a message

- **WHEN** the user types a message and presses Enter or clicks Send
- **THEN** the message is displayed in the chat area
- **AND** the message is sent to the backend agent endpoint
- **AND** the agent's response streams in real-time via SSE

#### Scenario: Agent response with file changes

- **WHEN** the agent creates or modifies a YAML semantic model file
- **THEN** the agent's response describes the changes made
- **AND** the changes are persisted to disk in the project's data directory

#### Scenario: Assistant message contains markdown

- **WHEN** the agent responds with markdown content (headings, code fences, lists, tables, bold/italic)
- **THEN** the content is rendered as formatted HTML with Tailwind-styled custom components
- **AND** code blocks display a language label (when specified) and a copy-to-clipboard button on hover
- **AND** tables render with proper column alignment and border styling

#### Scenario: Assistant message contains inline code

- **WHEN** the agent response includes inline code (single backticks)
